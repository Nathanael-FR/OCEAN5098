⚠ Practice 3.2 Create the following data frame from scratch. This short experiment aims at testing the efficiency of a diet made of bubble teas: three cups a day for a week. Weight of subjects is provided before and after this ‘bubble tea’ diet (the data are fake). Reformat this data frame to obtain the weight as a double into one column and the time of measurement as a factor with two levels before_diet and after_diet. You will store this data frame as the first element of a list called BUBBLE_DIET. The second element of this list will be another list called WEIGHT_LOSS, storing three elements: [1] a vector of character extracting the row names of the table previously created; [2] a numeric vector (double) indicating the weight loss of each subject (can be positive or negative, but calculated as a percentage of initial weight); [3] a combination of these two elements in a table with two columns: subject and weight_loss. The third element of the list BUBBLE_DIET will be any message saying how much you enjoy manipulating data in R.You will push both your .Rmd and .html files into a public repository available from your Github account.You will share with me be email [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw] the address (URL) of this repository (such as https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098.git) before next Monday in order for me to check your work. The title of your email should be `Practice 3.2 (your name: your student no.). ENJOY ;)
