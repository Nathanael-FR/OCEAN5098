⚠ Practice 1.3 Complete ADVANCED (see above). Push both the .Rmd and .html files into a public repository available from your Github account. You will send the address (URL) of this repository (such as https://github.com/vianneydenis/OCEAN5098.git) to [vianneydenis@g.ntu.edu.tw] before next Monday in order to check your work. Alternatively, if you could not ‘push’ you files, send them directly to me as attached files. The title of your email should be `Practice 1.3 (your name: your student no.). It will be challenging but once you succeed you will have master important functionalities of the R environment. Have fun ;)
